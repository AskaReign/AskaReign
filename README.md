## Welcome
I’m trying to improve my algorithmic knowledge and coding skills.
## What to expect from AskaReign in 2025

>"Expect nothing. Live frugally on **surprise**."

### Rules to live by (hard to hold onto):
- Be gentle with people, no matter what life throws your way.
- Speak kindly, even when it’s hard.
- They might say you shouldn’t tell people what you’re up to — that it makes you weak at finishing it.<br>
Bullshit.<br>
You don’t have to tell everyone everything, sure.<br>
But listen to this rapper dude, Jack Harlow:<br>
“Sometimes when I sit back and really let it register,
I did everything I said I would — and said it first.”
